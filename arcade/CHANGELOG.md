# Arcade — Changelog & Status

Single-file neon-vector browser games. `index.html` is the cabinet rack (reads `games.js`).
Each game is self-contained, zero-dependency, browser-play-tested. Reference style: `games/asteroids.html`.

> **Resume:** read this, then continue from "Next up". Commit after each game.

  - chomp.html ✅ — Pac-Man-lite: hand-authored 28×31 symmetric maze (fully connected, 4 power-pellets, wrap tunnel), grid-locked muncher with queued turns, 4 ghosts with faithful distinct AI (Blinky direct / Pinky 4-ahead ambush / Inky doubled-flank vector off Blinky / Clyde shy-within-8), scatter↔chase cycling, frightened+eyes+revive, escalating combo, levels, lives, full juice
- **Nav:** every game has a click-only `← arcade` back-link (NO key binding — games use keys).
- **Gallery:** index.html (neon "cabinet rack"), games.js manifest (11), README ✅

## Next up
- Optional more cabinets: Flappy/one-button, a procedural mini-roguelike, Pac-Man-lite,
  a twin-stick shooter, Frogger-lite, a rhythm game.
- 9 cabinets — a well-rounded rack (shooter / paddle / snake / falling-block / shmup / puzzle /
  defense / vs-CPU / physics-landing). Responsive `auto-fill` grid: adding more needs no rebalance.

## Log
- 2026-06-11 — Added **Chomp** (Pac-Man-lite → **11** cabinets): a neon maze-muncher on a
  hand-authored 28×31 tile map (validated programmatically: 28-wide, left/right symmetric, every
  one of 278 pellets reachable, exactly 4 power-pellets, both tunnel mouths wrap). Grid-locked
  movement model (entities lock to integer tiles and decide turns exactly at centers — this
  replaced an early proximity-epsilon scheme that dead-locked entities by snapping them back to
  the same center each frame). Self-verified by a subagent in a real browser (agent-browser):
  title→start, WASD/arrow steering + pellet scoring, scatter↔chase cycling (held scatter ~7s then
  flipped), power-pellet→frightened (all ghosts blue + reverse + slow + edible), eating frightened
  ghosts gives escalating 200→400→… combo, eaten ghost→eyes→returns to house→revives, ghost contact
  costs a life, game-over+restart, and full pellet-clear→level-advance (level 1→2, maze rebuilt).
  **The four ghosts were confirmed mathematically distinct** by reading each ghost's computed
  chase-target tile via a debug hook at several muncher positions/headings: Blinky targets the
  muncher's exact tile (direct), Pinky targets 4 tiles ahead of the muncher's facing (ambush),
  Inky uses the classic doubled vector from Blinky through the tile two ahead of the muncher
  (flank), and Clyde direct-chases when farther than 8 tiles but flees to his scatter corner when
  closer (shy) — all verified against the expected arithmetic. Sustained 60fps, JS heap stable
  ~10MB, 0 console errors/warnings throughout; silent by default. Single self-contained file, no
  network refs, retina-crisp.
- 2026-06-11 — Added **Crossing** (Frogger-lite → **10** cabinets): lanes of neon traffic + a river
  of logs/turtles you ride, goal bays, escalating levels, lives, full juice. Single-file, 60fps (after
  a background-canvas perf pass that moved static art + glow off the hot path), 0 console errors,
  silent by default; play-tested by a self-verifying subagent.
- 2026-06-10 — Added two cabinets (→ **9**): **Pong** (vs CPU — paddle-angle physics, beatable
  predictive AI, first to 11) and **Lunar Lander** (thrust/gravity flight, fuel budget, procedural
  terrain + multiplier landing pads, soft-land-vs-crash, escalating levels). Both single-file
  neon-vector, ~60fps, 0 console errors, silent by default; play-tested by self-verifying subagents.
- 2026-06-08 — Started Arcade. Built juicy Asteroids (subagent, play-tested). Scaffolded
  rack gallery (index.html + games.js + README). Snake + Breakout dispatched.
